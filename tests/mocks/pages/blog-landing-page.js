                        '<h3>Dealing with PMS: the physical</h3>\n<p>Growing up, menstruation education didn’t always touch on how to deal with PMS other than maybe popping a few ibuprofen for cramps. Now that we’re all older and wiser, we have some more remedies on hand for the next time those familiar aches and pains crop up:\n</p>\n<p>Some type of over-the-counter actually could help. One of the most familiar PMS treatments for things like headaches, cramping, or painful breasts is taking pain relieving drugs like ibuprofen or acetaminophen.You can take them according to directions on the bottle for your cramps or breast aches, but if you’d rather reach for an alternative…</p>\n<p>…there are also natural options for pain relief. Vitamins for PMS, or massaging on a topical essential oil blend or CBD balm to relieve those crampy spots, are all popular options for treating PMS naturally.</p>\n<p>Get physical. There are few things in life that a little exercise can’t help fix. Is your style to go for a brisk walk or take a virtual yoga class in your PJs? Either way, getting your blood flowing can both help with bloating and fatigue, and have emotional benefits (we’ll touch on that below).</p>\n<p>Apply some heat. Ahh, that’s the stuff. Whether you have an electric heating pad, hot water bottle, or single-use heating patches, placing a little extra warmth on the area in question can provide some relief. Hot tip: LOLA’s heating patch provides natural heat therapy for up to 11 hours. And, since it’s discreet and easy to wear, you’re free to move around as you please.</p>\n<p>Hydrate, baby! This advice spans well beyond just your PMS window, but drinking a good amount of water will help with bloating.</p>\n<p>Facemasks, pimple patches, spot treatments. The list goes on! Having an acne outbreak right before your period is totally normal. So while we say, “meh, just leave ‘em be!” you might simply want it to… go away. Your favorite pimple patches or sheet mask are a convenient option for soothing that skin.</p>\n<p>Even if you aren’t experiencing acne, some self-care in the form of a rose-scented face mask can do wonders for your PMS mental health — which brings us to…</p>\n<h3>How to handle PMS: the emotional</h3>\n<p>While the emotional symptoms of PMS have been thoroughly depicted in Hollywood, we think we speak for real humans everywhere by saying: actual PMS mood swings suck. They can make you focus on negative thoughts, have a blow-up over a seemingly small issue, or just feel generally… blah.</p>\n<p>Not every menstruator experiences this in the same way — some people’s symptoms fluctuate month-to-month, and some don’t get them at all. But if you’re someone who sometimes wonders, “Why do I get so angry before my period?” keep reading for some helpful tips to keep your hormones at bay.</p>\n<p>Rest up. Your body and mind need some R&R in order to restore — shoot for at least 8 hours of shut eye if you can. And if your cramps are also bothering you, try adding a little heat before you fall asleep for the night (it’ll feel like a much-needed bear hug).</p>\n<p>Get some fresh air. A lot of women say they feel some sort of PMS anxiety or depression. If you’re feeling blue, try going outside for a long walk or a quick jog. The boost in endorphins can help reset your mind.</p>\n<p>Make magnesium a priority. Magnesium has been shown to reduce PMS depression and stress in some women. But no need to run to the drugstore — you can find magnesium in a lot of foods you may already be eating: dark, leafy greens, salmon, avocados, and (our favorite option) dark chocolate.</p>\n<p>Just take a minute (or ten). You may have heard of the health benefits of meditating. Good news: they also apply before and during your period! When you’re feeling on the verge of a sobfest or just need a sec to cool off, find space to be by yourself. Open your favorite mindfulness app or close your eyes and breathe deeply.</p>\n<h3>For the in-between PMS symptoms (ahem, cravings)</h3>\n<p>Here’s our hot take: if your pre-period week consists of going all in on a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough, maybe just embrace your PMS cravings and treat yourself. While we are 100% advocates of living your best life — which includes sticking to the diet that best serves you — cut yourself some slack if your hormones convince you to indulge in more chocolate than usual.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for ways to satiate these cravings without feeling guilty, you can try reaching for craveable foods that aren’t processed and lack refined carbohydrates or caffeine. Increasing your intake of fiber and protein can also stabilize your blood sugar and your hormone production.</p>\n<h3>But why is my PMS so bad?</h3>\n<p>Hey! It’s us with a friendly reminder that every person’s pre-period experience is different (even your own symptoms could fluctuate from month-to-month). Your sister might need to lie in bed for a day to nurse her cramps, you might want to eat every sweet in your kitchen, while your best friend may feel totally fine before menstruation.</p>\n<p>That said, if your PMS symptoms have been getting more severe or the treatments above don’t help, you and your doctor might want to check out if there’s anything else going on beneath the surface. They may be able to provide you more insight into why you’re experiencing these symptoms and — hopefully — offer a solution.</p>\n<h3>Is there a cure for PMS?</h3>\n<p>We’ve covered different methods for dealing with PMS…but does a true cure exist for premenstrual syndrome? Though you may have heard that you don’t experience PMS on the pill, there’s no real evidence to prove that. However, a lot of people do say their PMS on birth control can be a little milder than when off it.</p>\n<p>While a PMS cure sounds like a dream, we haven’t yet found one for these energy-draining symptoms. Until then, we hope these tried and true methods and essential cramp care products help you feel a little more like yourself when the time strikes.</p>',

                        '<div class="entry__content">\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of your period like a rainbow. While period blood doesn’t include the full spectrum of the sun, it’s perfectly normal to have varying shades of red during menstruation. And sometimes it’s black. A change in hue is usually a sign of how quickly the blood is leaving the uterus, so don’t panic if you notice a lot of brown right before or during your period. But on some occasions, it can be a sign that something is wrong. Here’s a run down of what you need to know about the different colors that show up during your cycle.</span></p>\n\n<h2>If your<b> period blood</b> is pink…</h2>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of your period, a light flow might mix with cervical fluid and come out pink. However, the pale shade could also be a sign of low estrogen levels associated with certain hormonal birth control or perimenopause. Pink blood can also indicate an iron deficiency. “If your period has suddenly become incredibly light, kind of pale, and much less concentrated, it’s possible you’re anemic,” says Dr. Dweck.</span></p>\n\n<h2>If your<strong> period blood</strong> is red…</h2>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood that is fresh and flowing quickly is bright red. If your period wakes you up in the middle of the night — or you’ve been taking an afternoon nap — the pooling blood might turn a darker shade of red.</span></p>\n\n<h2>If your<strong> period blood</strong> is brown…</h2>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown blood often shows up at the beginning or end of a period when your flow isn’t at full speed. Without a vigorous push, the blood hangs around in the uterus for longer, and “the iron in the hemoglobin molecules in the blood begin to break down,” writes Dr. Lissa Rankin, a gynecologist and author of “What’s Up Down There?”.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, the blood starts to rust. It might look less than fresh, but it’s perfectly healthy.</span></p>\n\n<h2>If your<strong> period blood</strong> is black…</h2>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If blood takes a lot longer than usual to leave the uterus, it can turn black for the same reason it turns brown. When the uterine lining is done actively sloughing off, sluggish, old blood stays in the body longer and can come out much darker and thicker than what you see at the beginning of the cycle — think a paste of coffee grinds. “It’s just flowing much more slowly and it has time to oxidize and change color,” says Dr. Alyssa Dweck, a gynecologist in Westchester County, New York.</span> </p>\n\n<h2><b>When should I worry about the color of my period blood?</b></h2>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown discharge that happens outside of your period, and accompanies a fever or pain, can be a sign of pelvic inflammatory disease — an infection of the cervix and uterus, or a sexually transmitted infection like gonorrhea or chlamydia. Those with polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal imbalance, might see some brown spotting.</span> And though it is typically normal, black period blood could also indicate a blockage in your vagina. If you experience this color alongside other factors of irritation like fever or itching, you should call your doctor. </p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange, grey, or green discharge, especially if you’re not expecting your period, can be a sign of an infection like bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis — an STI caused by a parasite. In rare cases, brown or pale discharge with a foul odor can be a sign of cervical cancer. And if you’re pregnant and notice light pink, brown, or bright-red bleeding or spotting, head to a doctor. While 20-30 percent of pregnant people experience some bleeding, discharge could be a sign of a miscarriage.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you’re not pregnant and notice a change in your menstrual cycle that lasts for more than a few cycles — whether it’s in color, flow, or frequency — you might want to check in with your gynecologist. Otherwise, menstrual blood that varies in color isn’t a reason for concern.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women know their cycles and if something is off, they know about it,” says Dr. Dweck. “We’re our best gauge as to what’s normal.”</span></p>\n<span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span>\t\t\t</div>',

                        '<div class="entry__content">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Our periods can bring on a slew of not-so-great symptoms, like the mental and emotional side effects of PMS, that monthly jawline breakout, and painful cramps. Many women also experience digestive issues like gas, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation during their period.</p>\n<p>On a basic level, your period happens due to fluctuations in hormone levels, which cause the uterus to shed excess lining or tissue. But why does our stomach seem to go haywire at the same time? After all, it’s a totally different part of the body. We talked to Stefani Davis, a Women’s Health Nurse Practitioner (WHNP), to find out.</p>\n<h2>First things first: you’re normal</h2>\n<p>Davis reassured us that it’s totally normal to struggle with your upset stomach during your period. “Digestive issues during your period are really common,” she said. “Helping my patients understand that this is a common complaint among women and being open about the causes helps alleviate anxiety that they may be experiencing something abnormal.”</p>\n<p>But, Davis warned that those of us with underlying gastrointestinal issues may be more susceptible to digestive problems during our periods. “Women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) sometimes experience worse symptoms than women who don’t have a GI disorder.”</p>\n<h2>So what’s the culprit?</h2>\n<p>As it turns out, the chemicals and hormones that trigger our periods are likely responsible for our stomach woes, too. But, as Davis pointed out, it’s important to understand that there’s actually not a lot of research in this area.</p>\n<p>“While the exact science behind why digestive problems surface [during your period] is unknown, it’s reasonable to blame the hormones,” she said. “The fluctuations, or rises and falls, of estrogen, progesterone, and prostaglandins during your cycle also cause changes in the muscles of the GI tract, which control digestion.”</p>\n<h2>Why period hormones impact your stomach</h2>\n<p>“Estrogen and progesterone are the two hormones that regulate your menstrual cycle, while prostaglandins are a lipid, or fat, compound that actually act like a hormone in the body,” said Davis. “Like estrogen and progesterone, your level of prostaglandins also fluctuate during your period.” She explained there are different types of prostaglandins in the body, and one is specific to the female reproductive system. The amount of reproductive prostaglandins is what fluctuates during your period.</p>\n<p>“While it’s not known exactly why the GI tract is sensitive to hormonal changes throughout a woman’s cycle, it is known that there are sex hormone receptors located along the GI tract,” said Davis. So, the presence of sex hormone receptors in the GI tract is the reason why experts think women experience digestive issues during their period. Receptors interact with the hormones, and regulate certain physical responses to the hormones. Davis explained, “Progesterone is well known for causing constipation during pregnancy by slowing the motility, or the contraction of muscles, of the GI tract. On the other hand, estrogen tends to enhance GI motility, and can be to blame for diarrhea.”</p>\n<p>When asked about prostaglandins, Davis said, “Prostaglandins specific to the female reproductive system play a role in the contraction of uterine muscles, which can cause pelvic cramps. Because there are also sex hormone receptors along the GI tract, as there are in the uterus, we think prostaglandins can potentially impact muscles in the GI system, too, which leads to bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.”</p>\n<h2>Ways to start feeling better</h2>\n<p>“Some women may benefit from hormonal contraception, like birth control pills or a hormonal IUD, to help decrease the hormonal fluctuations that contribute to digestive issues,” said Davis. But for those of us that may also be struggling with IBD <span style="font-weight: 400;">or IBS flare up during your period</span>, it’s important to get treated for these specific digestive issues by a specialist first.</p>\n<p>Davis also recommended keeping a journal. “Write down and keep track of symptoms, diet, and physical activity to determine if certain triggers, like a type of food, worsen symptoms. From there, try to eliminate or avoid those triggers right before and during your period.”</p>\n<h2>A need for more research</h2>\n<p>Davis emphasized that there’s still a lot of research needed on this topic. “Honestly, further research needs to be done to determine the true reason behind what causes digestive issues during women’s periods. But, right now, hormones are the most likely explanation. Anything you can do to manage their fluctuation during your period is your best bet, whether it’s hormonal contraception or taking careful note of what you’re eating or doing [and how that affects your symptoms].”</p>\n<p>Even if you choose not to pursue these recommended routes, don’t forget that there’s nothing unusual or unnatural about symptoms <span style="font-weight: 400;">like constipation, bloating, and gas during your period</span>.

                        '<div class="entry__content">\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of your period like a rainbow. While period blood doesn’t include the full spectrum of the sun, it’s perfectly normal to have varying shades of red during menstruation. And sometimes it’s black. A change in hue is usually a sign of how quickly the blood is leaving the uterus, so don’t panic if you notice a lot of brown right before or during your period. But on some occasions, it can be a sign that something is wrong. Here’s a run down of what you need to know about the different colors that show up during your cycle.</span></p>\n\n<h2>If your<b> period blood</b> is pink…</h2>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of your period, a light flow might mix with cervical fluid and come out pink. However, the pale shade could also be a sign of low estrogen levels associated with certain hormonal birth control or perimenopause. Pink blood can also indicate an iron deficiency. “If your period has suddenly become incredibly light, kind of pale, and much less concentrated, it’s possible you’re anemic,” says Dr. Dweck.</span></p>\n\n<h2>If your<strong> period blood</strong> is red…</h2>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood that is fresh and flowing quickly is bright red. If your period wakes you up in the middle of the night — or you’ve been taking an afternoon nap — the pooling blood might turn a darker shade of red.</span></p>\n\n<h2>If your<strong> period blood</strong> is brown…</h2>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown blood often shows up at the beginning or end of a period when your flow isn’t at full speed. Without a vigorous push, the blood hangs around in the uterus for longer, and “the iron in the hemoglobin molecules in the blood begin to break down,” writes Dr. Lissa Rankin, a gynecologist and author of “What’s Up Down There?”.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, the blood starts to rust. It might look less than fresh, but it’s perfectly healthy.</span></p>\n\n<h2>If your<strong> period blood</strong> is black…</h2>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If blood takes a lot longer than usual to leave the uterus, it can turn black for the same reason it turns brown. When the uterine lining is done actively sloughing off, sluggish, old blood stays in the body longer and can come out much darker and thicker than what you see at the beginning of the cycle — think a paste of coffee grinds. “It’s just flowing much more slowly and it has time to oxidize and change color,” says Dr. Alyssa Dweck, a gynecologist in Westchester County, New York.</span> </p>\n\n<h2><b>When should I worry about the color of my period blood?</b></h2>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown discharge that happens outside of your period, and accompanies a fever or pain, can be a sign of pelvic inflammatory disease — an infection of the cervix and uterus, or a sexually transmitted infection like gonorrhea or chlamydia. Those with polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal imbalance, might see some brown spotting.</span> And though it is typically normal, black period blood could also indicate a blockage in your vagina. If you experience this color alongside other factors of irritation like fever or itching, you should call your doctor. </p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange, grey, or green discharge, especially if you’re not expecting your period, can be a sign of an infection like bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis — an STI caused by a parasite. In rare cases, brown or pale discharge with a foul odor can be a sign of cervical cancer. And if you’re pregnant and notice light pink, brown, or bright-red bleeding or spotting, head to a doctor. While 20-30 percent of pregnant people experience some bleeding, discharge could be a sign of a miscarriage.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you’re not pregnant and notice a change in your menstrual cycle that lasts for more than a few cycles — whether it’s in color, flow, or frequency — you might want to check in with your gynecologist. Otherwise, menstrual blood that varies in color isn’t a reason for concern.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women know their cycles and if something is off, they know about it,” says Dr. Dweck. “We’re our best gauge as to what’s normal.”</span></p>\n<span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span>\t\t\t</div>',

Since that’s the average, that means some kids are starting menstruation much earlier. Some say exposure to environmental toxins is causing earlier puberty and periods, while others attribute the decline in menstruation age to better nutrition plus a rise in childhood obesity — fat tissue contains estrogen, so the more of it a girl has, the higher her chances of starting puberty earlier.'

                        '<div class="entry__content">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Our periods can bring on a slew of not-so-great symptoms, like the mental and emotional side effects of PMS, that monthly jawline breakout, and painful cramps. Many women also experience digestive issues like gas, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation during their period.</p>\n<p>On a basic level, your period happens due to fluctuations in hormone levels, which cause the uterus to shed excess lining or tissue. But why does our stomach seem to go haywire at the same time? After all, it’s a totally different part of the body. We talked to Stefani Davis, a Women’s Health Nurse Practitioner (WHNP), to find out.</p>\n<h2>First things first: you’re normal</h2>\n<p>Davis reassured us that it’s totally normal to struggle with your upset stomach during your period. “Digestive issues during your period are really common,” she said. “Helping my patients understand that this is a common complaint among women and being open about the causes helps alleviate anxiety that they may be experiencing something abnormal.”</p>\n<p>But, Davis warned that those of us with underlying gastrointestinal issues may be more susceptible to digestive problems during our periods. “Women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) sometimes experience worse symptoms than women who don’t have a GI disorder.”</p>\n<h2>So what’s the culprit?</h2>\n<p>As it turns out, the chemicals and hormones that trigger our periods are likely responsible for our stomach woes, too. But, as Davis pointed out, it’s important to understand that there’s actually not a lot of research in this area.</p>\n<p>“While the exact science behind why digestive problems surface [during your period] is unknown, it’s reasonable to blame the hormones,” she said. “The fluctuations, or rises and falls, of estrogen, progesterone, and prostaglandins during your cycle also cause changes in the muscles of the GI tract, which control digestion.”</p>\n<h2>Why period hormones impact your stomach</h2>\n<p>“Estrogen and progesterone are the two hormones that regulate your menstrual cycle, while prostaglandins are a lipid, or fat, compound that actually act like a hormone in the body,” said Davis. “Like estrogen and progesterone, your level of prostaglandins also fluctuate during your period.” She explained there are different types of prostaglandins in the body, and one is specific to the female reproductive system. The amount of reproductive prostaglandins is what fluctuates during your period.</p>\n<p>“While it’s not known exactly why the GI tract is sensitive to hormonal changes throughout a woman’s cycle, it is known that there are sex hormone receptors located along the GI tract,” said Davis. So, the presence of sex hormone receptors in the GI tract is the reason why experts think women experience digestive issues during their period. Receptors interact with the hormones, and regulate certain physical responses to the hormones. Davis explained, “Progesterone is well known for causing constipation during pregnancy by slowing the motility, or the contraction of muscles, of the GI tract. On the other hand, estrogen tends to enhance GI motility, and can be to blame for diarrhea.”</p>\n<p>When asked about prostaglandins, Davis said, “Prostaglandins specific to the female reproductive system play a role in the contraction of uterine muscles, which can cause pelvic cramps. Because there are also sex hormone receptors along the GI tract, as there are in the uterus, we think prostaglandins can potentially impact muscles in the GI system, too, which leads to bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.”</p>\n<h2>Ways to start feeling better</h2>\n<p>“Some women may benefit from hormonal contraception, like birth control pills or a hormonal IUD, to help decrease the hormonal fluctuations that contribute to digestive issues,” said Davis. But for those of us that may also be struggling with IBD <span style="font-weight: 400;">or IBS flare up during your period</span>, it’s important to get treated for these specific digestive issues by a specialist first.</p>\n<p>Davis also recommended keeping a journal. “Write down and keep track of symptoms, diet, and physical activity to determine if certain triggers, like a type of food, worsen symptoms. From there, try to eliminate or avoid those triggers right before and during your period.”</p>\n<h2>A need for more research</h2>\n<p>Davis emphasized that there’s still a lot of research needed on this topic. “Honestly, further research needs to be done to determine the true reason behind what causes digestive issues during women’s periods. But, right now, hormones are the most likely explanation. Anything you can do to manage their fluctuation during your period is your best bet, whether it’s hormonal contraception or taking careful note of what you’re eating or doing [and how that affects your symptoms].”</p>\n<p>Even if you choose not to pursue these recommended routes, don’t forget that there’s nothing unusual or unnatural about symptoms <span style="font-weight: 400;">like constipation, bloating, and gas during your period</span>.

Vitamins for PMS, or massaging on a topical essential oil blend or CBD balm to relieve those crampy spots, are all popular options for treating PMS naturally.</p>\n<p>Get physical. There are few things in life that a little exercise can’t help fix. Is your style to go for a brisk walk or take a virtual yoga class in your PJs? Either way, getting your blood flowing can both help with bloating and fatigue, and have emotional benefits (we’ll touch on that below).</p>\n<p>Apply some heat. Ahh, that’s the stuff. Whether you have an electric heating pad, hot water bottle, or single-use heating patches, placing a little extra warmth on the area in question can provide some relief. Hot tip: LOLA’s heating patch provides natural heat therapy for up to 11 hours. And, since it’s discreet and easy to wear, you’re free to move around as you please.</p>\n<p>Hydrate, baby! This advice spans well beyond just your PMS window, but drinking a good amount of water will help with bloating.</p>\n<p>Facemasks, pimple patches, spot treatments. The list goes on! Having an acne outbreak right before your period is totally normal. So while we say, “meh, just leave ‘em be!” you might simply want it to… go away. Your favorite pimple patches or sheet mask are a convenient option for soothing that skin.</p>\n<p>Even if you aren’t experiencing acne, some self-care in the form of a rose-scented face mask can do wonders for your PMS mental health — which brings us to…</p>\n<h3>How to handle PMS: the emotional</h3>\n<p>While the emotional symptoms of PMS have been thoroughly depicted in Hollywood, we think we speak for real humans everywhere by saying: actual PMS mood swings suck. They can make you focus on negative thoughts, have a blow-up over a seemingly small issue, or just feel generally… blah.</p>\n<p>Not every menstruator experiences this in the same way — some people’s symptoms fluctuate month-to-month, and some don’t get them at all. But if you’re someone who sometimes wonders, “Why do I get so angry before my period?” keep reading for some helpful tips to keep your hormones at bay.</p>\n<p>Rest up. Your body and mind need some R&R in order to restore — shoot for at least 8 hours of shut eye if you can. And if your cramps are also bothering you, try adding a little heat before you fall asleep for the night (it’ll feel like a much-needed bear hug).</p>\n<p>Get some fresh air. A lot of women say they feel some sort of PMS anxiety or depression. If you’re feeling blue, try going outside for a long walk or a quick jog. The boost in endorphins can help reset your mind.</p>\n<p>Make magnesium a priority. Magnesium has been shown to reduce PMS depression and stress in some women. But no need to run to the drugstore — you can find magnesium in a lot of foods you may already be eating: dark, leafy greens, salmon, avocados, and (our favorite option) dark chocolate.</p>\n<p>Just take a minute (or ten). You may have heard of the health benefits of meditating. Good news: they also apply before and during your period! When you’re feeling on the verge of a sobfest or just need a sec to cool off, find space to be by yourself. Open your favorite mindfulness app or close your eyes and breathe deeply.</p>\n<h3>For the in-between PMS symptoms (ahem, cravings)</h3>\n<p>Here’s our hot take: if your pre-period week consists of going all in on a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough, maybe just embrace your PMS cravings and treat yourself. While we are 100% advocates of living your best life — which includes sticking to the diet that best serves you — cut yourself some slack if your hormones convince you to indulge in more chocolate than usual.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for ways to satiate these cravings without feeling guilty, you can try reaching for craveable foods that aren’t processed and lack refined carbohydrates or caffeine. Increasing your intake of fiber and protein can also stabilize your blood sugar and your hormone production.</p>\n<h3>But why is my PMS so bad?</h3>\n<p>Hey! It’s us with a friendly reminder that every person’s pre-period experience is different (even your own symptoms could fluctuate from month-to-month). Your sister might need to lie in bed for a day to nurse her cramps, you might want to eat every sweet in your kitchen, while your best friend may feel totally fine before menstruation.</p>\n<p>That said, if your PMS symptoms have been getting more severe or the treatments above don’t help, you and your doctor might want to check out if there’s anything else going on beneath the surface. They may be able to provide you more insight into why you’re experiencing these symptoms and — hopefully — offer a solution.</p>\n<h3>Is there a cure for PMS?</h3>\n<p>We’ve covered different methods for dealing with PMS…but does a true cure exist for premenstrual syndrome? Though you may have heard that you don’t experience PMS on the pill, there’s no real evidence to prove that. However, a lot of people do say their PMS on birth control can be a little milder than when off it.</p>\n<p>While a PMS cure sounds like a dream, we haven’t yet found one for these energy-draining symptoms. Until then, we hope these tried and true methods and essential cramp care products help you feel a little more like yourself when the time strikes.</p>',

Hot tip: LOLA’s heating patch provides natural heat therapy for up to 11 hours. And, since it’s discreet and easy to wear, you’re free to move around as you please.</p>\n<p>Hydrate, baby! This advice spans well beyond just your PMS window, but drinking a good amount of water will help with bloating.</p>\n<p>Facemasks, pimple patches, spot treatments. The list goes on! Having an acne outbreak right before your period is totally normal. So while we say, “meh, just leave ‘em be!” you might simply want it to… go away. Your favorite pimple patches or sheet mask are a convenient option for soothing that skin.</p>\n<p>Even if you aren’t experiencing acne, some self-care in the form of a rose-scented face mask can do wonders for your PMS mental health — which brings us to…</p>\n<h3>How to handle PMS: the emotional</h3>\n<p>While the emotional symptoms of PMS have been thoroughly depicted in Hollywood, we think we speak for real humans everywhere by saying: actual PMS mood swings suck. They can make you focus on negative thoughts, have a blow-up over a seemingly small issue, or just feel generally… blah.</p>\n<p>Not every menstruator experiences this in the same way — some people’s symptoms fluctuate month-to-month, and some don’t get them at all. But if you’re someone who sometimes wonders, “Why do I get so angry before my period?” keep reading for some helpful tips to keep your hormones at bay.</p>\n<p>Rest up. Your body and mind need some R&R in order to restore — shoot for at least 8 hours of shut eye if you can. And if your cramps are also bothering you, try adding a little heat before you fall asleep for the night (it’ll feel like a much-needed bear hug).</p>\n<p>Get some fresh air. A lot of women say they feel some sort of PMS anxiety or depression. If you’re feeling blue, try going outside for a long walk or a quick jog. The boost in endorphins can help reset your mind.</p>\n<p>Make magnesium a priority. Magnesium has been shown to reduce PMS depression and stress in some women. But no need to run to the drugstore — you can find magnesium in a lot of foods you may already be eating: dark, leafy greens, salmon, avocados, and (our favorite option) dark chocolate.</p>\n<p>Just take a minute (or ten). You may have heard of the health benefits of meditating. Good news: they also apply before and during your period! When you’re feeling on the verge of a sobfest or just need a sec to cool off, find space to be by yourself. Open your favorite mindfulness app or close your eyes and breathe deeply.</p>\n<h3>For the in-between PMS symptoms (ahem, cravings)</h3>\n<p>Here’s our hot take: if your pre-period week consists of going all in on a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough, maybe just embrace your PMS cravings and treat yourself. While we are 100% advocates of living your best life — which includes sticking to the diet that best serves you — cut yourself some slack if your hormones convince you to indulge in more chocolate than usual.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for ways to satiate these cravings without feeling guilty, you can try reaching for craveable foods that aren’t processed and lack refined carbohydrates or caffeine. Increasing your intake of fiber and protein can also stabilize your blood sugar and your hormone production.</p>\n<h3>But why is my PMS so bad?</h3>\n<p>Hey! It’s us with a friendly reminder that every person’s pre-period experience is different (even your own symptoms could fluctuate from month-to-month). Your sister might need to lie in bed for a day to nurse her cramps, you might want to eat every sweet in your kitchen, while your best friend may feel totally fine before menstruation.</p>\n<p>That said, if your PMS symptoms have been getting more severe or the treatments above don’t help, you and your doctor might want to check out if there’s anything else going on beneath the surface. They may be able to provide you more insight into why you’re experiencing these symptoms and — hopefully — offer a solution.</p>\n<h3>Is there a cure for PMS?</h3>\n<p>We’ve covered different methods for dealing with PMS…but does a true cure exist for premenstrual syndrome? Though you may have heard that you don’t experience PMS on the pill, there’s no real evidence to prove that. However, a lot of people do say their PMS on birth control can be a little milder than when off it.</p>\n<p>While a PMS cure sounds like a dream, we haven’t yet found one for these energy-draining symptoms. Until then, we hope these tried and true methods and essential cramp care products help you feel a little more like yourself when the time strikes.</p>',
